                <h3> About Us</h3>

                <p>
                    Traditional Pagan Crafts is a small business that started here in Kansas City in 2011. There are three founders; Jesse Molina, our lead instructor who specializes in Astrology and Tarot, secondary instructor Garnet Gabriel, who specializes in Jewelry and Gemstones, and Jennifer Dumar, who works in Sales and got the ball rolling by introducing the young crew to open-minded business professionals. These original three met while displaying their personal studios at First Fridays in downtown Crossroads KC. Being overwhelmed by the openness of people to their brilliant curiosity towards meaningful self-discovery, exploration, expression, and creation --- along with working with some of the greatest leaders in business --- it has been an incredible joy to see their recognition and this business grow exponentially over the years.

                    As you begin to embrace the "darker" side of life, black and white give dissolve into a beautiful circular spectrum of color and balance. You become an artist discovering and choosing pallets of infinite colors, whose sole focus is joy and grace. The spiritual and physical world exist constantly alongside one another in a yin and yang balance. It is very easy in today's society for the less plainly visible portion of this balance to be left behind and for imbalance to exist in our life and energy. Traditional Pagan Crafts wants for everyone to have that grace restored in their life - Not only for our neighbors to feel happy, be satisfied, and have youthful curiosity about their life, but because this balance and connection is the sole source of joy in this world. We want to provide you with the tools and guidance that you need for deep self understanding while also teaching you creative outlets that will help you express that connection that you can continue to grow and pursue at home.
